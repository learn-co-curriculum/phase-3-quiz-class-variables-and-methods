## Correct

True

> Fantastic! We can't call private methods on objects outside of a class, but we
> can call them on `self` within a class.

## Incorrect

False

> Try opening up a Ruby REPL and defining a class with a private method. Try
> calling that private method inside of the class on `self`, and then outside of
> the class on an object instantiated from that class. What happens?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
