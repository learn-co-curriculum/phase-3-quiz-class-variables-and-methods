our private methods below that.

## Correct

True

> methods below that. The only exception to this rule is that we don't declare
> `initialize` under `private`.

## Incorrect

False

> We need to tell Ruby that these methods are private, so the `private` method is
> required. We only need to call it once.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
