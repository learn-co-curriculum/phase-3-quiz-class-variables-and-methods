# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Book
  attr_accessor :author, :page_count, :genre
  attr_reader :title

  GENRES = []

  def initialize(title)
    @title = title
  end

  def self.genres
    GENRES
  end
end
```

Every time a genre is added to a `Book` object, we want to store that genre in
the class constant `GENRES`. The code above doesn't currently do this. Select
the code snippet that does.

## Correct

```rb
class Book
  attr_accessor :author, :page_count
  attr_reader :title

  GENRES = []

  def initialize(title)
    @title = title
  end

  def genre=(genre)
    GENRES << genre
    @genre = genre
  end

  def self.genres
    GENRES
  end
end
```

> Wow! Nailed it!! By creating a setter and adding the genre to `GENRES` in the
> setter, we achieve exactly what we want.

## Incorrect

```rb
class Book
  attr_accessor :author, :page_count, :genre
  attr_reader :title

  GENRES = []

  def initialize(title)
    @title = title
    GENRES << self
  end

  def self.genres
    GENRES
  end
end
```

> This isn't actually adding the genre to `GENRES`. What is the code actually
> adding, and what should it be doing instead?

## Incorrect

```rb
class Book
  attr_accessor :author, :page_count
  attr_reader :title
  attr_writer :genre

  GENRES = []

  def initialize(title)
    @title = title
  end

  def genre
    GENRES << @genre
  end

  def self.genres
    GENRES
  end
end
```

> This is a bit of a weird one, and not quite right. When is the genre being
> added to `GENRES`? What will happen every time you try to read the `genre`
> property on an object? If you're not sure, try running the code, adding a
> genre, and then reading the genre a few times before running `Book.genres`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
