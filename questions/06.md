# OO Concepts

Why do we declare private methods? Select all that apply.

## Correct

They signal to other developers that these are dependencies for other methods in
the class.

> Yes! We often declare helper methods that don't need to be accessed outside of
> the class as private methods.

## Correct

They encapsulate functionality that doesn't need to be exposed or accessed
outside of the class.

> So true! Any functionality that doesn't need to be accessed outside of a class
> can be safely tucked away in a private method. Exposing only those methods
> developers need to work with can protect the data in your class and make your
> code easier to work with.

## Incorrect

They signal to other developers that these methods are okay to remove in the
future, because they're not really needed.

> Private methods are often helper methods that other public methods rely on.
> Deleting them could be quite disastrous.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
