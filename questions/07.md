# OO Syntax

What type of constant is defined within a class and is available to all
instances of a particular class?

## Correct

Class

> Amazing! Class constants have the same value no matter which instance is
> accessing it. It is a shared constant and is also accessible inside of class
> methods.

## Incorrect

Global

> A global constant would be available to all class instances, not just a single
> class. It would also be available to methods outside of classes, and, well,
> everywhere.

## Incorrect

Instance

> We don't declare constants inside of instance methods. What kind of constant
> might we need if we want all of the instances of a class to have access to the
> same value?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
